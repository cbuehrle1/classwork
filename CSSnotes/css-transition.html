        <div class="body-text">
          <p>Normally when you make a css class change to an html element, whether through hover effect or even JavaScript, the process is instantaneous. However using CSS Transitions, won can give time limits, or specifically an transition period between one state and the other.</p>
          <p>As stated by MDN, "CSS transitions let you decide which properties to animate (by listing them explicitly), when the animation will start (by setting a delay), how long the transition will last (by setting a duration), and how the transition will run (by defining a timing function, e.g. linearly or quick at the beginning, slow at the end)."</p>
          <p class="transition">And when you mouse over this paragraph, there is a little example for you.</p>
          <p>For more indepth information and reference material, please head to <a class="darker" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions">MDN's</a> article as well as their <a class="darker" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties">reference list.</a> </p>

        <h2 class="secondary-header">CSS Animations</h2>
        <div class="body-text">
          <p>To create a CSS animation sequence, you style the element you want to animate with the animation property or its sub-properties. This lets you configure the timing, duration, and other details of how the animation sequence should progress. This does not configure the actual appearance of the animation, which is done using @keyframes.</p>
          <p>The properties are very similar in description as CSS Transitions. Instead of doing an effect based off triggered class change, CSS animations does exactly what it says; you animate the element.</p>
